As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming event. Given that on the first day you run x miles, and by the event you must be able to run y miles.
Calculate the number of days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the event, if you increases your distance each day by 10% from the previous day.

Print one integer representing the number of days to reach the required distance. 
x = int(input())
y = int(input())
i = 1
while x < y:
    x *= 1.1
    i += 1
print(i)
